/*
SIGFOX logger program based on the Atim SigBee module
- plug the light sensor between the A4 and GND pins
- repeatedly read the light sensor from analog pin A4
- send the value to the SIGFOX network every 10 minutes
  (maximum 140 messages per day)
   
1. upload this program to The AirBoard via the BLE-LINK shield
2. replace the BLE-LINK shield by the SIGFOX shield
3. connect to the SIGFOX backend: http://backend.sigfox.com

The AirBoard is a thumb-size, Arduino-compatible, wireless, low-power,
ubiquitous computer designed to sketch Internet-of-Things, fast!

// the setup routine runs once when you switch on the board:
void setup() {
  pinMode(BLUE, OUTPUT);                             // initialize the BLUE LED pin as an output
  digitalWrite(A4, HIGH);                            // set internal pull-up for light sensor

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
